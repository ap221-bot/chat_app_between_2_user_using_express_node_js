# chat_app_between_2_user_using_only_express_node_js
i have created a basic chat application on my own by using only express framework(no use of socket) for 2 users specifically.(for more users work is under progress)

How to use:
1. start the server
2. open localhost in two tabs
3. in 1 tab login through user 1
4. in 2nd tab login throgh user 2
5. try to send message to each other and you will see the output as real chat app.
